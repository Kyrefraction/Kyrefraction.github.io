			<div class="content">
				<h5>Stay duration: 2 days, 2019</h5>
				<p>The capital of the south: Naples, or Napoli in Italian. An immensely important historic city, home to the Palazzo Reale di Napoli, Castelnuovo & the Piazza del Plebiscito. A place where all beings are overlooked by the distant Monte Vesuvio. There is a vibrant feeling rising from the well-walked streets, though the bustle is not without its downsides.</p>
				<img src="resources/IMG_20190731_144645-min.jpg" loading="lazy" class="basicImage">
				<p>Napoli struggles with waste management. Between 1994 and 2008 Campania even declared it to be in a state of emergency, and whilst the worst has passed, the city is still hampered by its ineffectiveness at dealing with litter. Coupled with the infamously dodgy driving, the city is masked by an air of inhospitality. Its people are much the opposite however. People are friendly, as they tend to be in Italy, and are happy to provide one of the most iconic foods the world over, that is of course, pizza. Napoli invented pizza, all the way back in the 18th Century, and its supremacy is still unmatched the world over. A simple margherita is a culinary journey through the intricate balance between the sweet passata and the charred base.</p>
				<img src="resources/IMG_20190731_140646.jpg" loading="lazy" class="basicImage">
				<p>A quintessential Italian city, Napoli is full of character and gives you much to take in. For day trips out of the city: the Amalfi Coast, a coastal paradise, lies just to the south-east.</p>

			<div class="content">
				<h5>Stay duration: 7 days, 2019</h5>
				<p>Taranto is a special place for me. It is where I find family, and a few childhood memories. It feels as much like home as a city can. There are three main parts to Taranto: Tamburi, Citt√† Vecchia and Taranto. Citt√† Vecchia means old city, and lives up to its namesake. It is full of beautiful historic buildings. On the outskirts of the old town are two Doric columns which were once part of an ancient Greek temple of Poseidon constructed in the 6th century BC, over 2,500 years ago. Bridging the old to the new is Ponte Girevole, which lies next to Il Castello Aragonese, a great medieval castle now available to the public through guided tours.</p>

				<img src="resources/PonteGirevole-min.JPG" loading="lazy" class="rightImage">
				<p>The city comes to life after 18:00, where families begin to stroll down Via D'aquino, a street adorned with restaurants, shops and gelaterie. In perusing the menu's you'd find an abudance of frutti di mare (shellfish), of which the quality is sublime. Mussels are caught fresh in the Mare Piccolo in the early hours of the morning, and find themselves served the same day in the restaurants that lie next to it. Alongside them is provided the most affordable and best wine in all of the Mezzogiorno. I've yet to enjoy shellfish dishes as delicious as those served in Taranto.</p>

				<p>Being a coastal city, Taranto has easy access to the sea. A short drive takes you to some local beaches near Pulsano and Talsano. Its climate is warm, fresh and brings clear skies year round. Though the air is not without its problems. The city has been marred for some decades by Ilva SPA, a steel production company that brought Taranto the biggest steel plant in Europe and with it the title of third most polluted city in the world due to factory emmissions. In 2005 the Ilva plant accounted for 83% of the emissions reported for the entirety of Italy. The population of Taranto is dwindling. Ilva is a stain on an otherwise beautiful city.</p>

			<h3 class="collapsible">üè∞  Milano  üè∞</h3>
			<div class="content">
				<h5>Stay duration: 7 days, 2019</h5>
				<p>The capital of both fashion and northern Italy: Milan is a flourishing international city that boasts beautiful architecture and style. Being a large city, there is much do to in its boundaries, though it is not too sprawling as to become too overwhelming. The Duomo, The Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, the Sforzesco Castle and Sempione Park all lie inside the city. The buildings are grand in size, rivaling the landmarks of Roma to the south, and give a quality of wealth to the city. Wealth is a theme that runs throughout all of Milano, it is one of the richest cities in Italy and staying there has a price tag akin to that of Venezia.</p>
				<img src="resources/Galleria-min.JPG" loading="lazy" class="leftImage">
				<img src="resources/Galleria2-min.JPG" loading="lazy" class="rightImage">
				<p>Northern italian food is of a different strain than that of the south. Traditional tomato based dishes are of higher quality in the southern regions. That leaves the north to carry the torch for the creamier, and lighter dishes. The risotto in Milano was wonderful, and I happy enjoyed it on multiple days. There is a nice steakhouse, la "bis" bistecca in Porta Nuova that served a delicious steak and patatine fritte combination. North-east of the Duomo is the Quadrilatero della moda, the fashion district. Here even window shopping is a luxurious experience, with efforts from Luisa Beccaria, Acne Studios and the famous Italian brands: Prada, Gucci and Versace.</p>
				<img src="resources/IMG_20190520_144611-min.jpg" loading="lazy" class="basicImage">
				<p>A short north-eastery train journey away is a city named Bergamo. This city has a certain fairytale-like qualtiy to it, due to the presence of La Citt√† alta, the high city - a walled settlement atop a hill overlooking the lowlands. To ascend to the high city, you choose the bridge or take the funicolare, both transport you to a dream-like realm where ambient piano fill the 16th century streets. From the ramparts the lowlands are visible for miles, a vista to behold.</p>

				<p>Northwards of Milano is the alps. Stretching from Austria to France and cutting through the northernmost tip of Italy. It is in this mountain range that you can find Como, where I travelled to for one day. Como is a city at the southern tip of a lake with the same name, and alongside lake Garda is the epitome of alpine lakeside beauty. You can easily spend a day in como, strolling alongside the lake and taking in the grandeur of mountains constrasted with the calm waves of the water.</p>

			<div class="content">
				<h5>Stay duration: 4 days, 2019</h5>
				<p>Palmanova was the place I stayed in my visit to Mallorca, a resort and a microcosm of sorts for the whole island. Mallorca attracts more than its fair share of tourists every year. Tourists which are generally less appreciative of culture and cuisine and more overly-indulged in intoxication. This isn't entirely reflective of the Balearic island however, as a day trip to Palma, the capital of the island, showers its visitors in mediterrean and gothic spendour.</p>
				<img src="resources/IMG_20190512_153208-min.jpg" loading="lazy" class="basicImage">
				<p>It was in Palmanova that I first enjoyed Paella. A Spanish rice & seafood dish, that reminds me of the Tarantinian orecchiette and mussel dishes. Being an island, there's no lack of wonderful seafood dishes. It was in a "French" restaurant on the island that I had a delectable black spaghetti dinner, one of my favourite meals so far.</p>

			<h3 class="collapsible">üü•  Nanjing  üü•</h3>
			<div class="content">
				<h5>Stay duration: 1 month, 2018</h5>
				<p>Nanjing was the first place I visited outside of Europe and my introduction to China. I spent one month on a scholarship course as a student of mechanical engineering & mandarin at the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (Âçó‰∫¨Ëà™Á©∫Ëà™Â§©Â§ßÂ≠¶). The summer scholarship was a life changing time, I made some close friends from my own University, from Sweden and from the University itself. I learnt a lot in my time there, not only from my course but from the people there and their way of life, which is so different from my own. Having spent a month there, I experienced a great deal and will attempt to go through my experiences with some coherency.</p>
				<img src="resources/20180620_204852-min.jpg" class="basicImage">
				<p>The first thing I noticed upon arriving in China was the sheer scale of all of the structures there. It seemed that every building I saw broke the record for the tallest building I'd ever seen. This includes the Jiangning building 1, the tall tower in the centre of my campus. The cities in China are often of megalopolis ranking; traveling there gives you a foreshadowing of a cyberpunk future, an ethos which is vibrant and alive in China. There are few places in the world that come so close to the physical incarnation of "blade runner" as cities like Chongqing and Shanghai do. Nanjing, in comparison to its bigger brothers, is much more green and in line with the European sized cities. Downtown Nanjing has its fair share of skyscrapers, but they're balanced by the local fauna not too far from the centre.</p>

				<img src="resources/20180707_160113-min.jpg" loading="lazy" class="rightImage">
				<p>Chinese food is completely different to European style food, and completely different to European Chinese food too. From what I could tell, most Chinese people don't have a kitchen in their home, instead they eat out every day, the cheap pricing permits them to do so. At my University campus a large bowl of plain rice cost 0.8ÂÖÉ, the equivalent of 9 pence in British Sterling. This coupled with a drink, some fried chicken (the best dish available in the campus, and definitely the most popular), and another dish set me back only around 8ÂÖÉ (90 pence) per meal. After the two weeks of Mandarin, I was proficient enough to order my dishes in the local language. In the campus canteen, you would select your dishes, go to a desk to be given a receipt detailing how much it costs, then go to a cashier and either show them the receipt or tell them the price. I got fairly used to saying BƒÅ ku√†i and showing the BƒÅ hand gesture - that's right! Mainland China uses specific hand gestures to show numbers 1-10 on only one hand and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_number_gestures">it's really cool</a> (North Chinese was the one I used).

				<img src="resources/20180629_165601-min.jpg" loading="lazy" class="rightImage">
				<p>
				Other than the campus canteen, I ate out in the local town centre fairly often, sometimes in KFC (which was really popular with the locals) or Burger King but usually in the local restaurants. Chinese waiters would often show you to your table and then stand at your table, sometimes for 10 minutes whilst you and your group perused the menu and decided what to eat, something we all found a little funny and sometimes uncomforting. I was informed that the crayfish were a seasonal local dish, so ate some on my first night. They were quite enjoyable but required thorough effort to get through their shells, I unfortunately cut my gum on one the first night. Not far from the NUAA Jiangning campus is a place literally called "Pakistan Restaurant", they served a great spicy Karahi dish, something that contrasted the local Nanjing cuisine - it was really very mild in flavours generally. 
				</p>
				<img src="resources/20180614_212433-min.jpg" class="basicImage" loading="lazy">
				<p>Closeby was a brew dog, very popular with my University group. The owner, called Jerry had us over many evenings to watch the world cup football with him and his cat called Tom (Tom & Jerry, how adorable). In the local supermarket, there were fresh eels, turtles, tortoises and toads for consumption, something you'd never see in Europe. Restaurants would often have cooking ducks in their windows, the head of one I believe was a delicacy.</p>
				<img src="resources/20180611_113202-min.jpg" loading="lazy" class="leftImage">
				<img src="resources/20180619_203839-min.jpg" loading="lazy" class="rightImage">
				<p>An area that China unfortunately falls behind in is hygiene. They're still completely dependent on and accustomed to squat toilets, which if you're not used to can really be difficult to use if you're on there for an extended period of time. The Chinese sewage systems wouldn't permit anything other than human waste to be put into it, that means you had to hold your used toilet paper whilst still squatting until you were finished. Afterwards you would bin your toilet paper in a large bin in the centre of the toilet room, which was sometimes overflowing. The smell was incredibly pungent in any non-air conditioned room, that means all corridors and teaching rooms not in use, but thankfully not our dorms. The dorm's showers weren't much better, the floor was thick with clear sludge and the water itself wasn't particularly clean. No Chinese tap water is clean for that matter, it must be boiled before being used for anything; The University water fountains put out boiling hot water. This lack of hygiene did unfortunately translate into the cuisine at times. It wasn't too rare for someone to be off from having food poisoning.</p>
				<img src="resources/20180613_125520-min.jpg" loading="lazy" class="basicImage">
				<p>The customs of Chinese culture can sometimes be quite a shock when you're over there. People are eager to take photos of every foreigner they see, even unconsented close-ups. This gets worse the further you go into less international places. Many Chinese people express disapproval and annoyance if they ever have to wait in a queue anywhere, which is doubly painful as Chinese people seem to take forever to order anything. The elderly in China have gotten around this conundrum by trying to cut to the front of any queue they find themselves in. Nobody waits for you to exit before trying to get on any transport, and at times you'll get a gentle push if you're descending an escalator at too leisurely a pace. No Chinese person I ever talked to was ever rude however, and they seemed to be chuffed to hear you speak their native language. I think generally they are a good peoples, they're just not quite as polite. I think being white affords you a certain level of privilege there, I heard a lot of my peers saying they felt more free in China than they did in the U.K. but I'm certain this doesn't apply to all foreigners. China could definitely make your life somewhat difficult if they wanted to.</p>
				<img src="resources/20180610_193947-min.jpg" loading="lazy" class="basicImage">
				<p>The public transport there is incredible, and incredibly cheap! It was built very recently and honestly is a standard countries should aspire to. The local underground was well connected and good at keeping congestion down, much better than the London underground in my opinion. There were security checkpoints for entering any underground station however, and embarking on a train journey required you to bring your passport. The trains themselves were nice and spacious, each row was 3 + 2 seats with ample leg room. They reached speeds of ~300km/h, making the journeys out of Nanjing Nan Station quick and enjoyable.</p>
				<img src="resources/20180621_125849-min.jpg" loading="lazy" class="basicImage">
				<p>As for Nanjing itself: Fuzimiao was a nice downtown shopping area, the 1912 district gives a decent night out, even though all the clubs seem to exclusively play dubstep. I visited the porcelain tower, which had a lot more to it than just the tower itself and the Nanjing massacre memorial which was very moving.</p>
				<img src="resources/20180707_133637-min.jpg" loading="lazy" class="leftImage">
				<img src="resources/20180615_100845-min.jpg" loading="lazy" class="rightImage">
				<p>For a while Nanjing was home, and as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_city_tier_system">"New Tier 1"</a> city it feels much more familiar and welcoming than the bigger <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_city_tier_system">"Tier 1"</a> lot, and even more welcoming than the other cities in its own bracket. I don't see there being much draw for visiting as a tourist, it's more a city to live in.</p>

			<div class="content">
				<h5>Stay duration: 2 days, 2018</h5>
				<p>As alluded to earlier, Shanghai is a behemoth of a city and is one of the four Chinese <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_city_tier_system">"Tier 1"</a> megacities. With a population the comparable to that of Australia's, it's nigh impossible not to find yourself surrounded by people. Looking on a map, you'd notice that Shanghai's urbanisation is vast, so much so that it begins to merge into neighbouring Suzhou. It is a concrete jungle.</p>
				<img src="resources/20180623_194137.jpg" class="basicImage" loading="lazy">
				<p>One of the tallest buildings in the world, the Shanghai Tower sits just across the Huangpu river from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bund">The Bund</a>, a historically Euro-American settlement on the west bank of the river, that architecturally belongs to the 1920s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Deco">Art Deco</a> movement. The view is breathtaking. All throughout the city, brief glimpses of the distant Lujiazui monoliths impose the sheer immensity of their engineering. A deep tone of power and weight emanates from the earth on which they stand. I spent an evening in wonder, gazing at the edifice.</p>
				<img src="resources/20180623_115332.jpg" loading="lazy" class="basicImage">
				<p>Shanghai is an international Chinese city, it shows its foreign influence - there's a Taco Bell in the Pudong district - but it is also distinctly Chinese. On my journey back to my hotel, upon exiting the Shanghai metro I was greeted with people dancing. The Shanghainese seem fairly keen on it, they danced on the platforms and on the streets. It was quite heartwarming to see. An aspect of Chinese culture I was unaware of, yet happy to have experienced... and no I did not join in.</p>
				<img src="resources/20180623_212722.jpg" loading="lazy" class="basicImage">
				<p>I enjoyed my short time in Shanghai, I would like to return one day. There is a lot to the city still unexplored. The air there has a thick and dirty quality to it, so searching out a face mask is wise, despite that I had nothing but positive experiences in Shanghai.</p>
