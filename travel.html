			<h3>Napoli</h3>
				<p>The capital of the south: Naples, or Napoli in Italian. An immensely important historic city, home to the Palazzo Reale di Napoli, Castelnuovo & the Piazza del Plebiscito. A place where all beings are overlooked by the distant Monte Vesuvio. There is a vibrant feeling rising from the well-walked streets, though the bustle is not without its downsides.</p>

				<p>Napoli struggles with waste management. Between 1994 and 2008 Campania even declared it to be in a state of emergency, and whilst the worst has passed, the city is still hampered by its ineffectiveness at dealing with litter. Coupled with the infamously dodgy driving, the city is masked by an air of inhospitality. Its people are much the opposite however. People are friendly, as they tend to be in Italy, and are happy to provide some of the best food you could find. Napoli invented pizza, all the way back in the 18th Century, and its supremacy is still unmatched the world over. A simple margherita is a culinary journey through the intricate balance between the sweet passata and the charred base.</p>

				<p>A quintessential Italian city, Napoli is full of character and gives you much to take in. For day trips out of the city: the Amalfi Coast, a coastal paradise, lies just to the south-east.</p>

			<h3>Taranto</h3>
				<p>Taranto is a special place for me. It is where I find family, and childhood memories. It feels as much like home as a city can. There are three main parts to Taranto: Tamburi, Città Vecchia and Taranto. Città Vecchia means old city, and lives up to its namesake. It is full of beautiful historic buildings. On the outskirts of the old town are two Doric columns which were once part of an ancient Greek temple of Poseidon constructed in the 6th century BC, over 2,500 years ago. Bridging the old to the new is Ponte Girevole, which lies next to Il Castello Aragonese, a great medieval castle now available to the public through guided tours.</p>

				<p>The city comes to life after 18:00, where families begin to stroll down Via D'aquino, a street adorned with restaurants, shops and gelaterie. In perusing the menu's you'd find an abudance of frutti di mare (shellfish), of which the quality is sublime. Mussels are caught fresh in the Mare Piccolo in the early hours of the morning, and find themselves served the same day in the restaurants that lie next to it. Alongside them is provided the most affordable and best wine in all of Italy. I've yet to enjoy shellfish dishes as delicious as those served in Taranto.</p>

				<p>Being a coastal city, Taranto has easy access to the sea. A short drive takes you to some local beaches near Pulsano and Talsano. Its climate is warm, fresh and brings clear skies year round. Though the air is not without its problems. The city has been marred for some decades by Ilva SPA, a steel production company that brought Taranto the biggest steel plant in Europe and with it the title of third most polluted city in the world due to factory emmissions. In 2005 the Ilva plant accounted for 83% of the emissions reported for the entirety of Italy. The population of Taranto is dwindling. Ilva is a stain on an otherwise beautiful city.</p>
