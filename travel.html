			<h3 class="collapsible">Napoli  üçï</h3>
			<div class="content">
				<h5>Stay duration 2 days, 2019</h5>
				<p>The capital of the south: Naples, or Napoli in Italian. An immensely important historic city, home to the Palazzo Reale di Napoli, Castelnuovo & the Piazza del Plebiscito. A place where all beings are overlooked by the distant Monte Vesuvio. There is a vibrant feeling rising from the well-walked streets, though the bustle is not without its downsides.</p>

				<p>Napoli struggles with waste management. Between 1994 and 2008 Campania even declared it to be in a state of emergency, and whilst the worst has passed, the city is still hampered by its ineffectiveness at dealing with litter. Coupled with the infamously dodgy driving, the city is masked by an air of inhospitality. Its people are much the opposite however. People are friendly, as they tend to be in Italy, and are happy to provide one of the most iconic foods the world over, that is of course, pizza. Napoli invented pizza, all the way back in the 18th Century, and its supremacy is still unmatched the world over. A simple margherita is a culinary journey through the intricate balance between the sweet passata and the charred base.</p>
				<img src="resources/IMG_20190731_140646.jpg" loading="lazy" class="basicImage">
				<p>A quintessential Italian city, Napoli is full of character and gives you much to take in. For day trips out of the city: the Amalfi Coast, a coastal paradise, lies just to the south-east.</p>

			<div class="content">
				<h5>Stay duration 7 days, 2019</h5>
				<p>Taranto is a special place for me. It is where I find family, and childhood memories. It feels as much like home as a city can. There are three main parts to Taranto: Tamburi, Citt√† Vecchia and Taranto. Citt√† Vecchia means old city, and lives up to its namesake. It is full of beautiful historic buildings. On the outskirts of the old town are two Doric columns which were once part of an ancient Greek temple of Poseidon constructed in the 6th century BC, over 2,500 years ago. Bridging the old to the new is Ponte Girevole, which lies next to Il Castello Aragonese, a great medieval castle now available to the public through guided tours.</p>

				<img src="resources/PonteGirevole-min.JPG" loading="lazy" class="rightImage">
				<p>The city comes to life after 18:00, where families begin to stroll down Via D'aquino, a street adorned with restaurants, shops and gelaterie. In perusing the menu's you'd find an abudance of frutti di mare (shellfish), of which the quality is sublime. Mussels are caught fresh in the Mare Piccolo in the early hours of the morning, and find themselves served the same day in the restaurants that lie next to it. Alongside them is provided the most affordable and best wine in all of the Mezzogiorno. I've yet to enjoy shellfish dishes as delicious as those served in Taranto.</p>

				<p>Being a coastal city, Taranto has easy access to the sea. A short drive takes you to some local beaches near Pulsano and Talsano. Its climate is warm, fresh and brings clear skies year round. Though the air is not without its problems. The city has been marred for some decades by Ilva SPA, a steel production company that brought Taranto the biggest steel plant in Europe and with it the title of third most polluted city in the world due to factory emmissions. In 2005 the Ilva plant accounted for 83% of the emissions reported for the entirety of Italy. The population of Taranto is dwindling. Ilva is a stain on an otherwise beautiful city.</p>

			<h3 class="collapsible">Milano  üè∞</h3>
			<div class="content">
				<h5>Stay duration 7 days, 2019</h5>
				<p>The capital of both fashion and northern Italy: Milan is a flourishing international city that boasts beautiful architecture and style. Being a large city, there is much do to in its boundaries, though it is not too sprawling as to become too overwhelming. The Duomo, The Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, the Sforzesco Castle and Sempione Park all lie inside the city. The buildings are grand in size, rivaling the landmarks of Roma to the south, and give a quality of wealth to the city. Wealth is a theme that runs throughout all of Milano, it is one of the richest cities in Italy and staying there has a price tag akin to Venezia.</p>

				<p>Northern italian food is of a different strain than that of the south. Traditional tomato based dishes are of higher quality in the southern regions. That leaves the north to carry the torch for the creamier, and lighter dishes. The risotto in Milano was wonderful, and I happy enjoyed it on multiple days. There is a nice steakhouse, la "bis" bistecca in Porta Nuova that served a delicious steak and patatine fritte combination. North-east of the Duomo is the Quadrilatero della moda, the fashion district. Here even window shopping is a luxurious experience, with efforts from Luisa Beccaria, Acne Studios and the famous Italian brands: Prada, Gucci and Versace.</p>
				<img src="resources/IMG_20190520_144611-min.jpg" loading="lazy" class="basicImage">
				<p>A short north-eastery train journey away is a city named Bergamo. This city has a certain fairytale-like qualtiy to it, due to the presence of La Citt√† alta, the high city - a walled settlement atop a hill overlooking the lowlands. To ascend to the high city, you choose the bridge or take the funicolare, both transport you to a dream-like realm where ambient piano fill the 16th century streets. From the ramparts the lowlands are visible for miles, a vista to behold.</p>

				<p>Northwards of Milano is the alps. Stretching from Austria to France and cutting through the northern-most tip of Italy. It is in this mountain range that you can find Como, where I travelled to for one day. Como is a city at the southern tip of a lake with the same name, and alongside lake Garda is the epitome of alpine lakeside beauty. You can easily spend a day in como, strolling alongside the lake and taking in the grandeur of mountains constrasted with the calm waves of the water.</p>

			<div class="content">
				<h5>Stay duration 4 days, 2019</h5>
				<p>Palmanova was the place I stayed in my visit to Mallorca, a resort and a microcosm of sorts for the whole island. Mallorca attracts more than its fair share of tourists every year. Tourists which are generally less appreciative of culture and cuisine and more overly-indulged in intoxication. This isn't entirely reflective of the Balearic island however, as a day trip to Palma, the capital of the island, showers its visitors in mediterrean and gothic spendour.</p>
				<img src="resources/IMG_20190512_153208-min.jpg" loading="lazy" class="basicImage">
				<p>It was in Palmanova that I first enjoyed Paella. A Spanish rice & seafood dish, that reminds me of the Tarantinian orecchiette and mussel dishes. Being an island, there's no lack of wonderful seafood dishes - it was in a "French" restaurant on the island that I had a delectable black spaghetti meal.</p>
